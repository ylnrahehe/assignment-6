Hello! This website is a student project made by two people. As you may have seen, it is about movie reviews. Let's break down
the functionality of it:
On the home page we have a carousel of popular movies, which you could click and get redirected to the movie page with 
details about it. Also you can see upcoming movies and some of the scores and reviews. You could also change the website theme
on top of the page. As well as filter the review scores table however you'd like!
Then, we have the shows page, with simillar functionality.
Next, we move onto the login page, where you can log into your account and later, log out.
When you log in, you'll be redirected to your profile page. It includes info about you, with your favorite movies and shows,
and your personal reviews.
If you want to support us, you could also get a monthly or a yearly subscription which provides you with additional benefits!
